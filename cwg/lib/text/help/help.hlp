! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"

Examples:

  > tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.

  > ^rasmusse^rasmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

  > ^you^you doing^

%TRANSFORM% MTRANSFORM OTRANSFORM TRANSFORM

%transform% <vnum|-vnum>

   This command causes the executing mob or object to transform into another 
mob or object, based on the vnum argument supplied. The transformation is 
permanent, though additional transformations may be performed. No message 
regarding the transformation is sent to the room. The new mob or object will 
have the same script as the original, rather than any script normally assigned 
to the new, and no load trigger will be executed.

   Mobs - The hit points, max hit points, position, gold, and experience value 
will remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions 
will be those of the new mob. (The new mob can be made to have all of its normal 
statistics by using a negative vnum.) Only mobiles may use this command (naturally).

   Objects - Based on the vnum argument supplied. The four basic values will 
remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions will 
be those of the new object. The transformation is permanent, additional 
transformations may be performed. No message regarding the transformation is 
sent to the room. The new object will have the same script as the originating 
object, rather than any script normally assigned to the new object, and no 
load trigger will be executed.

Example: @RTSTAT 21, 1370@n

AC

"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:


  AC  Roughly equivalent to
-----------------------------------------------------------
  10  Naked person
   0  Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -10  Armored battle tank

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-10 to 10.)

ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

  > advance rasmussen 34

ALIAS ALIASES

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

#1
ANSI COLOR

Usage: color [off | brief | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color brief
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

The colorcode entry will show you what codes can be used to make what colors.

Zone names CAPITALIZED are accessed by teleporter. i.e. "teleport sanctus"
Uncitalized zones are linked through a capitalized zone.
Teleporter: Trigger 99.

The current_world.tgz file includes all the above zones. Just unpack it in the 
main directory of your MUD and you will have (as of Feb 04):
   7068 mobiles           3443 prototypes
   7376 objects           4164 prototypes
  11552 rooms              175 zones
   1022 triggers

If you wish to see what standards we have used to balance these zones just stop
by TBA and see the help files on OBJ-LIMITS, MOB-LIMITS.

A huge thank you goes to Welcor for everything he has done for TBA and CircleMUD.
Thanks to everyone who donated their time and effort.

ASSIST

Usage: ASSIST <person in need>

If Quifael is being beaten senseless by a warg and you feel brave enough
to help him, type ASSIST QUIFAEL to hit the warg.  Note that the warg will
keep hitting Quifael; assist only makes you start to fight whomever the

ASTAT

Usage: astat <social>

See Also: OASIS AEDIT
#1
ATTACH

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

Usage: attach mob {trigger vnum/name} {mob name} [location]
       attach obj {trigger vnum/name} {obj name} [location]
       attach room {trigger vnum/name} {room vnum} [location]

   Attach lets you attach a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for
testing or other purposes. The command only attaches the script once,
and will not last over a reboot (or crash).

The 'location' is what number in the triggerlist the trigger will assume.
It is important to first attach a trigger to test before you manually add it
through oedit/medit/redit. 

Examples:
attach room 14500 14520 - Attaches room trigger 14500 to room 14520.
attach mob 1332 santa   - Attaches mob trigger 1332 to mob 1308 (santa).
attach obj 1480 sword   - Attaches obj trigger 1480 to a sword.

AUCTION GOSSIP GRATS NOAUCTION NOGOSSIP NOGRATS

Usage: auction <message>
       gossip <message>
       grats <message>

These are channels reserved for specific purposes.  Messages on these
channels reach everyone who is monitoring them.  You must be at least level
three to use these channels.

Examples:

  > auction short sword -- minimum bid 100k
  > gossip Hey, is that a short sword on your belt or are you happy to see me?
  > grats LEVEL!!!!!!!!
  > grats GRATS CATJE!!!!!!!!

#1
AUTOEXIT

Usage: autoexit [ off | normal | complete ]

Toggles the automatic display of currently available exits.  Not all
possible exits will be displayed, only those immediately available.
If a door is closed it will not show up as a possible exit. In normal
mode, available exit directions are listed in a single line, while in
complete mode, each available exit, and the room name the exit leads to,
is shown on individual lines.

Autoexit without a value shows your current autoexit level.

#1
BACKSTAB

Thief only.

Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your dagger
in his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage.  A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:

    Levels  Multiplier
    ------  ----------
     1-7        2
     8-13       3
    14-20       4
    21-30       5

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild.  You can always backstab sleeping
people.
#1
BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

#31
BANK WITHDRAW DEPOSIT BALANCE

Commands to take money out of the bank, put money in the bank, or see how
much money you have in the bank.  Can be used at any branch of the First
National Bank of CircleMUD (wherever you see an automatic teller machine).

Examples:

  > deposit 400
  > withdraw 1000
  > balance

See also: GOLD, SCORE
#1
BASH

Fighters only.

The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned.  To bash someone
is to attempt to 'knock' that person over.  If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on it's rear.  The victim will be
unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence.  If you miss you loose
your balance and fall.

A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.

Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5 * damage.

Accumulative: No

than five pounds per level of caster. 
#1

Usage       : cast 'blindness' <victim>
Accumulative: No

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

See also: MAIL, READ, WRITE
#1
BRIEF

Usage: brief

Toggle "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of
the room you are in; only the name of the room and the people and objects
there.  Unless you're very familiar with the area in which you're traveling,
however, it is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find
small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

If you explicitly type 'look', you will always see the full room description,
even in BRIEF mode.

See also: COMPACT, LOOK
#1
BUG TYPO IDEA

Usage: bug <bug report>
       idea <your new idea>
       typo <that nasty typo>       

For making useful suggestions and reporting problems to the Powers that Be.

Examples:

  > bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'
  > idea make a restaurant in Midgaard
  > typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'
#1
BUILDWALK

Usage: buildwalk

This command toggles "buildwalking" mode on and off.  In this mode, walking
in a direction where a room doesn't exist will find the next available room
vnum in that zone, create a new room with that vnum, and make a two way link
between the room the builder was standing in and the new room.

them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMud folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

CLERIC

Clerics have an ancient belief in not carrying sharp weapons.  Hence, they can
only wield bludgeoning weapons.  This class gives you the wisdom of peace,
blessing and healing, though it is possible to learn more violent spells.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See 'help spells' for a list of spells available.

COMMANDS

Usage: commands

The COMMANDS command gives a canonical list of all the known verbs.

Each command listed should have help available by typing "HELP <command>".

See also: SOCIAL, SOCIALS
#1
COMMENT * 

* This is an example of a comment in trigedit. Because of the *'s the lines 
* are not parsed, so the script still works even if it has a lot of 
* explanations built in. All triggers should be heavily commented.

* The below line sends the text 'Trigger firing' to the room.
%echo% Trigger firing

   Comments are useful in scripts to document what is happening, for future 
reference, and for others to see what the script does.

#0
COMPACT

Usage: compact

This command toggles the extra blank line output to your screen after each
command.  Useful if you have a small display.

See also: BRIEF
#1
COMPARE

usage: compare <object1> <object2>

This command allows you to judge the relative effectiveness of two similar
objects.  You may only compare certain types of objects (weapons, armor and
treasure), and then only similar types to each other. You cannot, for example
compare a wooden shield to a huge diamond.  You will be told whether they
are about the same, or which seems better or worse.
#1
CONSIDER

Usage: consider <monster>

This command will compare your Level with the <monsters> level.  You will then
receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact.  Consider does not take
hitpoints/special attacks/damage into account.

Example:

  > consider fido

See also: HIT, KILL
#1
CONTEXT

Usage: context number
* This little script will make sure one %has_said_hello% exist for each player.
context %actor.id%
set has_said_hello 1
global has_said_hello
* now only scripts running with context = %actor.id% can access this particular 
* variable. however - it's a better idea to use vars set on players: help remote.

   Changes the "context" of a script to this value. When first run, a script's 
context is 0. When a variable is made global, it is given the current context. 
When a variable is accessed, if it must be searched for globally, a "found" 
variable must either have context 0 or the current context. The net result of 
this is you may have many global variables in a single script, with the same 
name, differing only by context. Players may have variables; this mostly 
removes the need for variable context. Previously, a player's ID could be used 
as variable context to allow a script to service multiple players at once.

DETACH

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

other purposes. The command only removes the trigger temporarily, until the
room/obj/mob is reloaded via reboot, zreset, load.

Use the optional arguments 'mob' and 'obj' to differentiate if more entities
with the same alias are in the room.

Examples:

DWARF

Dwarves are known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand 
physical and magical punishment, their knowledge of the earth's secrets, their 
hard work, and their capacity for drinking ale. Their mysterious kingdoms, 
carved out from the insides of mountains, are renowned for the marvelous 
treasures that they produce as gifts or for trade.

Dwarves are slow to laugh or jest and suspicious of strangers, but they are 
generous to those few who earn their trust. Dwarves value gold, gems, jewelry, 
and art objects made with these precious materials, and they have been known to
succumb to greed. They fight neither recklessly nor timidly, but with a careful
courage and tenacity. Their sense of justice is strong, but at its worst it can
turn into a thirst for vengeance. Among gnomes, who get along famously with 
dwarves, a mild oath is "If I'm lying, may I cross a dwarf."

Dwarves stand only 4 to 4 1/2 feet tall, but they are so broad and compact that
they are, on average, almost as heavy as humans. Dwarven men are slightly taller
and noticeably heavier than dwarven women. Dwarves' skin is typically deep tan 
or light brown, and their eyes are dark. Their hair is usually black, grey, or 
brown, and worn long. Dwarven men value their beards highly and groom them very
carefully. Dwarves favor simple styles for their hair, beards, and clothes. 
Dwarves are considered adults at about age 50, and they can live to be over 400
years old.

ELF

Elves mingle freely in human lands, always welcome yet never at home there. They
are well known for their poetry, dance, song, lore, and magical arts. Elves 
favor things of natural and simple beauty. When danger threatens their woodland
homes, however, elves reveal a more martial side, demonstrating skill with 
sword, bow, and battle strategy.

Elves are more often amused than excited, more likely to be curious than greedy.
With such long lives, they tend to keep a broad perspective on events, remaining
aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether
an adventurous mission or learning a new skill or art, they can be focused and 
relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget
them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with 
vengeance.

Elves are short and slim, standing about 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet tall and typically
weighing 85 to 135 pounds, with elven men the same height as and only marginally
heavier than elven women. They are graceful but frail. They tend to be 
pale-skinned and dark-haired, with deep green eyes. Elves have no facial or body
hair. They prefer simple, comfortable clothes, especially in pastel blues and 
greens, and they enjoy simple yet elegant jewelry. Elves possess unearthly grace
and fine features. Many humans and members of other races find them hauntingly 
beautiful. An elf achieves adulthood at about 110 years in age and can live to 
be over 700 years old.

EVAL

Usage: eval <variable> <expression>

* this example immediately evaluates the expression below and stores the result
* in %result%:
eval result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
* this result will not change after the evaluation even if %self.hitp% changes.

   The eval command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the result of the immediate evaluation of the provided expression. There also 
exists a "set" command, with the same syntax. Set differs in that the expression
is not evaluated until the variable is accessed.

EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

EXPRESSIONS TRIGEDIT-EXPRESSIONS INCREMENTS MATHEMATICAL /= || \

A false expression is any expression that evaluates to 0, or an empty string.
A true expression is any expression that evaluates to anything other than a
false expression. The following list are the recognized operators. The higher
the operator is on the list, the higher the precedence. The expression is
evaluated from left to right. Parenthesis can be used to group.

This spell is the most powerful spell a magic user can cast.

See also: "COLOR SPRAY"
#1
FLAGS

Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  FLAG        MEANING
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  (KILLER)    Player is trying to kill other players.  That means you
              can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
  (THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
  (invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are
              sensitive to the presence of invisible things.

  (mailing)   Player is writing mail; do not disturb.
  (deaf)      Player has chosen not to hear shouts.

#1
FLEE

Usage: flee

If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
(maybe you are dying), just type 'flee', and presto!  You are out of harms way

See also: GROUP, SNEAK
#1
FORCE

Usage: force <victim | all> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Example:

  > force fido drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.
#31
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: SET -> FROZEN
#31
FRENCH

Don't you know how they kiss in France?? -- try it!
#1
FURNITURE COUCH CHAIR

   There is no object type for furniture since this is stock CircleMUD. But it
can be done through trigedit. Just set the object type to OTHER and attach a
trigger similar to the example below. Just change the word chair to the name
you desire.

Example: @RTSTAT 1399@n
#0
GET TAKE

"Get" and "take" are exactly the same and can be used interchangeably.

Usage: get | take <object>
       get | take all [object]
       get | take all all.<object>
       get | take all.<object> all.<object>

If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick
it up.  'get' can also be used to extract items from containers.

Examples:

  > get sword corpse
  > get all corpse
  > get all all.bag
  > get all.bread all.bag

See also: DROP, PUT
#1
GIVE

Usage: give <object> <victim>
       give <number> coins <victim>

If you feel benevolent, you may give some stuff to someone in need.

  > give all ras
  > give bread doctor
  > give all.bronze mirlen
  > give 40000 coins nia
#1
GLOBALS GLOBAL-VARIABLES GLOBAL-VARS GVARS

Usage: global variablename
* To make a variable 'reachable' from other scripts it has to be made 'global'. 
* In this case I make a local known var %has_bribed_guard% and make it global. 
* It's a good idea to use this in conjunction with context.
global has_bribed_guard

   Used to change a variable from local to global. If a global variable is 
modified, this command must be used to update the global contents as well.

Example: @RTSTAT 45@n

See Also: VARIABLES, CONTEXT
#0
GNOME

Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite
the demand for their skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind,
living in comfortable burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills where animals abound
but hunting is a very bad idea.

Gnomes adore animals, beautiful gems, and jokes of all kinds. Gnomes have a 
great sense of humor, and while they love puns, jokes, and games, they relish 
tricks -- the more intricate the better. Fortunately, they apply the same 
dedication to more practical arts, such as engineering, as they do to their 
pranks.

Gnomes are inquisitive. They love to find things out by personal experience. At
times they're even reckless. Their curiosity makes them skilled engineers, since
they are always trying new ways to build things. Sometimes a gnome pulls a prank
just to see how the people involved will react.

Gnomes stand about 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin 
ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be 
any shade of blue. Gnomes males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes 
generally wear leather or earth tones, and they decorate their clothes with 
intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and
they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.

GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

See also: EQUIPMENT, REMOVE, WEAR, WIELD
#1
GROUP

Usage: group [player]
       group all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"
  Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

learn and practice the skills of their trade.

See also: PRACTICE
#1
HALT

Usage: halt

   Halt terminates the trigger execution.    

* This script attacks players of level 20 and above. The reason for the use of

end
  %echo% %self.name% yells a Battlecry and throws himself at you.

#1
HELP

Usage: help [command]

Help searches for a partial match of the entered word, including any
spaces that may follow the word.  Help alone will give a list of the
most common commands in the game.

Examples:

  > help mag
    will match 'magic user' or 'magic missile' depending on first
    occurrence in the help file.

#1
HIDE

Thieves Only.

When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room.  If hidden
you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell.  Even if sensed your
identity will remain hidden.  Hide is broken by pressing return, regardless
of whether you typed a command or not.

Example:

  > hide
  Ok.
  >  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

  >  (You pressed enter and no longer hide)

   Invisible people and objects, even if you don't have 'detect invisibility'
   Hidden people, even if you don't have 'sense life'
   Dark rooms, even if you don't have a light

It is expected most immortals will keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time;
it exists so that you have the ability to see what mortals see for
debugging purposes.
#31
HOUSE

The HOUSE command is used to add or remove guests from your house's guest
list.  You must be standing in your house to use this command.  Only the
primary owner of a house (not guests) may change the guest list using the
HOUSE command.

Usage: house [<player name>]

Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on
your house's guest list.  Typing 'house' with the name of a player will add
that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will
remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on the list.
The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

Guests of your house will be able to enter your house until you remove them
from the guest list.

See also: HOUSES
#1
HOUSES

Houses have been implemented as of CircleMUD 3.0.  A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house and
quit; your objects will drop to the ground and be crash-saved for when you
return.  There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses; contact your local Implementor for
a fee schedule.

#1
HUMAN

Most humans are the descendants of pioneers, conquerors, traders, travelers, 
refugees, and other people on the move. As a result, human lands are a mix of 
people -- physically, culturally, religiously, and politically. Hardy or fine, 
light-skinned or dark, showy or austere, primitive or civilized, devout or 
impious, humans run the gamut.

Humans are the most adaptable, flexible, and ambitious people among the
common races. They are diverse in their tastes, morals, customs, and habits.
Others accuse them of having little respect for history, but it's only natural 
that humans, with their relatively short life spans and constantly changing 
cultures, would have a shorter collective memory than dwarves, elves, gnomes, 
and halflings.

Humans typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weight from 
125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Thanks to
their penchant for migration and conquest, and to their short generations, 
humans are more physically diverse than other common races, with skin shades 
that run from nearly black to very pale, hair from black to blond (curly, kinky,
or straight), and facial hair (for men) from sparse to thick. Plenty of humans 
have a dash of nonhuman blood, and they may demonstrate hints of elven, orc, or
other lineages. Humans are often ostentatious or unorthodox in their grooming 
and dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothiers, tattoos, body 
piercings, and the like. Humans have short life spans, achieving adulthood at 
about age 15 and rarely living even a single century.
#1
IF ELSEIF END

Usage: if (expression)
...
 elseif (expression)
...
 else
...
 end
   if (if %actor.vnum% == -1) 
     %echo% You are a player
   else 
     %echo% You are a mob.
   end

   An 'if' must occur before the other three. If expression evaluates to true 
(@RHELP EXPRESSIONS@n), the statements between the if statement and the next 
elseif, else, or end are executed. If it stopped at an elseif or else, it scans 
for the next end, and continues execution at that point. If the expression 
evaluated to false, it searches for the next elseif, else, or end. If it finds 
an elseif, it checks that expression. If it is true, it executes the statements 
between the elseif and the next elseif, else, or end, and then finds the end of
the block. If it is false, it continues searching in the same pattern, until a 
true elseif is found, an else is found, or an end is found. There may be 0 or 
1 else statements and 0 or many elseif statements in the block.

For anyone having trouble with the format of if/elseif/else/end blocks
@RTSTAT 22@n. Relsqui made this excellent example.

***EVERY IF NEEDS AN END: 2 IF'S NEEDS 2 ENDS....***

#1
INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

See also: OFFER, RENT
#1
INVENTORY

Usage: inventory

If you're uncertain about what you're carrying, or simply want to check
that no thieves have got to your backpack.

See also: EQUIPMENT, GRAB, HOLD, REMOVE, WEAR
#1
INVIS

Usage: invis [level]

INVIS sets your invisibility level.  With no argument, invis toggles between
making you fully visible and fully invisible.  If you specify a level, only
people at and above the level you specify will be able to see you.

Makes the target of the spell invisible to everyone except those who have
the "detect invisibility" spell.

Attacking while invisible will immediately break the spell.

See also: "DETECT INVISIBILITY"
#1
JUNK

Usage: junk <object>
       junk <number> coins

Use JUNK instead of DROP if you want to keep the world a little cleaner.  If
you JUNK something, it will disappear and you'll get a few coins or experience
points, just as if you had dropped it in the dump.

Examples:

  > junk cup
  > junk all.bronze
  > junk 500 coins

See also: DONATE, DROP
#1
KICK

Fighters only.

Usage: kick <victim>

The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned.  The higher
level you reach the harder you kick.  There is one small catch -- whenever
you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three 
rounds of 'Violence' -- so be sure that you do not need to flee!

See also: BASH, RESCUE
#1
KILL HIT

Usage: kill <victim>

This spell is more powerful than the shocking grasp spell.

See also: "SHOCKING GRASP"
#1
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

your name in the WHO list.

See also: FLAGS, HOLLER, SHOUT, TOGGLE, WHO
#1
NOSUMMON

Usage: nosummon

Due to problems we've had with players killing other players by summoning
them to Bad Places, all characters now have SUMMON PROTECTION turned on by
default.  This prevents people from summoning you and gives you a warning
message if someone tries.  If you want to let someone summon you (i.e. if
someone wants to summon you for a legitimate reason), type NOSUMMON to turn
off summon protection.  You can then type NOSUMMON again to turn protection
back on.

NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS NUMARG NARG TRIGEDIT-NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS TRIGEDIT-ARGUMENTS 

4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments   : 

Dependant on the trigger type, these values will mean different things. For 
instance, if you've decided to use a hitpcnt trigger, the numeric Arg is the 
percent a mobs hit points have to fall to, before the trigger is activated, 
and the command list is executed.

OASIS

OasisOLC is the name given to a set of on line editing tools that can be
used by authorized players to examine, change and create the various world
entities that make up the Mud environment.  It is referred to as "on line"
creation because it allows people to create and edit things while the mud
is running, or on line.  This is opposed to the traditional method of editing
the various text files that comprise the mud "world" using various off-line
editors (typically vi or emacs), and the restarting the mud so that the
updated files are reloaded.

Categories of Oasis Commands
----------------------------

1)  Commands to examine the existing mud operation.  These are the [x]list
    commands, that can be used to view a range of world objects, and give
    a summary of their descriptions.  The actual commands are:
    astat - Actions (socials) status   rlist - List Rooms
    mlist - List Mobiles               slist - List Shops
    olist - List Objects               zlist - List Zones

2)  Commands to change or create entities and mud operation values.  The
    commands are:
    aedit - Actions (socials) editor   redit - Room editor
    cedit - Configuration editor       sedit - Shop editor
    medit - Mobile editor              tedit - Text file editor
    oedit - Object editor              zedit - Zone editor

3)  Miscellaneous commands.
    buildwalk - Create rooms by walking around
    dig       - Open exits between two rooms
    rclone    - Create a copy of a room

Using the Editing Commands
--------------------------

All of the edit commands are menu driven.  See OASIS-EDIT for general
instructions on how the menu interface works.

Granting Access to Oasis Commands
---------------------------------

Access to the Oasis commands are controlled through a number of means.  Of
course, the master command list (in interpreter.c) specifies the minimum
level for a player to call the command.  This is typically set to either
LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD.  A few commands are restricted to the implementor.

A player can always edit a zone and its contents if their name is in the 
zone builders list (see ZEDIT for more information).  Finally, a player 
may be granted OLC rights to a specific zone by means of the "set" command,
using "set <player> olc <zone>".

The implementor has unfettered access to all Oasis commands.

External Documentation
----------------------

Refer to "The CircleMUD Builder's Manual" that is shipped with the CircleMUD
distrobution, as this provides considerable invaluable information that is 
essential to anyone building on a mud, whether off-line or using Oasis.  The
main reference documentation for OasisOLC can be found at:

     http://dgstripts.n3.net/

OASIS-EDIT

The OasisOLC edit programs make use of a menu interface, and each of the
various commands has a similar appearance.  Each attribute of the thing
you are editing is listed, with a menu number against it.  These numbers
start from the number 1, run through the digits to 9, then use the letters
A onwards.  You enter the number (or letter) corresponding to the item you
wish to change.

Some menu items will lead to sub-menus, for example setting various bit
fields.

In general, the letter "Q" will quit (with the option to save) the menu
level you are currently at, although some sub-menus use the number "0"
to leave the menu.

Types of Menu Items
-------------------

1)  Single value items.  These correspond to attributes that have a single
    value or a simple list.  For example, a room name, an object's weight,
    or the lsit of aliases for a mobile.  Enter the value(s) and press the
    return key.

2)  Long text fields.  This corresponds to a multi-line text string, such
    as a room's description.  This makes use of the "enhanced edit" text
    editor.  Use the "/h" command in the editor to see the various options.

3)  Multi-value fields.  This is a menu item where you have to enter several
    values, such as an object's value flags, where there can be up to four
    values that you have to enter.  Each value will have its own prompt, so
    enter the value as directed by the prompt, and press the return key.

4)  Bit string fields.  This menu item goes to a sub-menu, with all of the 
    possible bit values listed.  You can select as many values as you wish, 
    with each menu number on this sub-menu toggling its corresponding flag
    on and off.  Use the menu item "0" once you have set all the flags you
    require to return to the top menu.

5)  Multiple choice fields.  This is where the attribute has one of a number
    of possible values, such as an object's type or a room's sector type.
    The sub-menu will list all the possible values, so to choose the value
    you want, enter the menu item number that corresponds to the particular
    choice you want.  This is unliek the bit string field, in that once you 
    make a choice, that value is recorded and you are returned to the upper
    menu.

RELOAD

Usage: reload < '*' | all | file >

Reload is used to reload text files such as the MOTD from disk into memory.
reload * reloads all the text files below.

Valid files are:

  background (/mud_dir/lib/text/background)
  credits    (/mud_dir/lib/text/credits)
  greetings  (/mud_dir/lib/text/greetings)
  handbook   (/mud_dir/lib/text/handbook)
  help       (/mud_dir/lib/text/help)
  immlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/immlist)
  imotd      (/mud_dir/lib/text/imotd)

  wizlist    (/mud_dir/lib/text/wizlist)
  xhelp      (/mud_dir/lib/text/help/*)
#31
REMOTE

Usage: remote <variable> <id>

Remoting a variable saves that variable to the player file for future access. 
This is used heavily for quests to limit a player to only performing it once.
Here is a quick example from zone 14. The variable must first be set and then
saved to the players file via remote, like:
  * setting the variable to 1 means completed.
  set solved_example_quest_zone_14 1
  remote solved_example_quest_zone_14 %actor.id%
Then in future triggers it is checked if that variable already exists in the
player file. In this example, if it does the player is not allowed to continue.
<variable> should always be a unique name. I suggest always including zone #.
<id> can be any value or text you wish to use later.

   Create a global variable belonging to a character or player whose id is 
specified. The variable must first exist in the script that is running.

For more examples go through the trigedit hallway.
Examples: @RTSTAT 1409-1411, 23612-23614@n

invisible sends you a message.

#1
SAVE

Usage: save

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

See also: INN, RENT

SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT YELL HOLLER '

Usage: say | shout | holler <string>

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  > ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Holler
broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.

  > sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)

#1
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

SHOW

Usage: show <mode> [argument]

Valid Modes:

death          errors         godrooms       houses
player         rent           shops          stats
zones   

The SHOW command displays information.  Some modes of show require additional
information, such as a player name.

   death: Shows all death traps in the game.
  errors: Shows errant rooms.
godrooms: Shows the rooms in the 'god zone'.
  houses: Shows the houses that are currently defined.
  player: Shows player summary information, simply provide a player name.
    rent: Shows the filename and path to a players rent file.
   shops: Shows all the shops in the game and their buy/sell parameters.
   stats: Shows game status information including players in game, mobs etc.
   zones: Shows all the zones in the game and their current reset status.
          An age of -1 means it is in the 'to be reset next' queue.

#31
SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.
#31
SKILLSET

Usage: skillset <name> '<skill>' <value>

Sets the specified skill to the specified value.

See also: SET
#31
SLEEP

SLEEP is both a command and the name of a spell.

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your health more
quickly.  You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while asleep.
You can awaken yourself with the WAKE command.

The SLEEP spell forces the victim into a magical sleep such that they cannot
be awakened until the spell wears off.

Usage       : cast 'sleep' <victim>
Accumulative: Yes (Duration)
Duration    : 4 hours + level/4
Level       : Mage level 8.

If failing saving throw versus spell, the person will fall asleep.
A person who is affected by sleep can only be awakened if attacked.

See also: WAKE
#1
SLIST

Usage: slist
       slist .
       slist <zone>
       slist <start room> <end room>

This provides a list of shops, giving the shop vnum, rnum and the room
vnum(s) that the shop is located in.  When called without any parameters, 
or by "slist .", all shops in the zone you are currently in will be listed.  
Alternatively, you can specify a particular zone number, and all shops in 
that zone will be listed, or a minimum and maximum shop vnum, and all rooms 
in that range will be listed.

#1
SLOWNS

Usage: slowns

Toggles whether or not IP addresses are resolved into readable site names.
If slow nameserver is enabled, USERS will show only IP addresses.
(128.123.222.111 etc).

See also: USERS
#31
SMILE

Whenever you feel like smiling...
#1
SNEAK

Thieves Only.

Usage: sneak

Used for sneaking (moving in and out of rooms without anyone taking notice).
When you type sneak, there is no way to know if you're actually sneaking.
If you successfully sneak, then you'll continue to sneak for a little while.

See also: HIDE
#1
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command; 
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.
#31
SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.
#31
SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

  > socials

SPLIT

Usage: split <amount to split>

Split is used to split money among people in your group who are in the same
room as you.  If you are in a group with 4 other people, all of whom are in
the same room with you, and you type SPLIT 100, you will give each of the
other 4 group members 20 coins each.  (100 coins is split 5 ways; you keep
your share and give everyone else their share).

#1
STAT

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with
names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

Examples:

  > stat fido
  > stat player red
  > stat mobile red
  > stat file niandra
  > stat object thunderbolt

See also: VSTAT
#31
STEAL

Thief Only.

Usage: steal <item> <victim>

Use steal to steal gold or items from people.  The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is now illegal to steal from other
players.  Doing so will get you a flag for your trouble.

Examples:

  > steal gold drunk
  > steal sword mercenary
    (If it's wielded, only possible if he is sleeping)

See also: FLAGS
#1
STRENGTH

Usage       : cast 'strength' <victim>
Accumulative: Yes
Duration    : Level/2 + 4
Level       : Mage level 6.

A person will gain 1 strength point per spell (2 points if level of
caster is greater than 18).  Maximum strength is 18/100.
#1
STRING

Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The
format is:

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.

Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently cannot be strung.
#31
SUMMON

Usage       : cast 'summon' <victim>
Accumulative: -
Duration    : Instantaneous
Level       : Cleric level 10.

Will summon a person of the name spoken.  It is not possible to
summon someone of three or more levels above yourself.
If you attempt to summon a monster, it will get a saving throw.

#1
SWITCH

Usage: switch <monster>

SWITCH is used to take over the body of mobiles; useful for interactive
adventures.  If the monster in which you are switched is killed you will be
returned to your own body.

See also: RETURN
#31
SYSLOG

Usage: syslog [off | brief | normal | complete]

The SYSLOG command controls how detailed of an on-line system log you see.
Messages surrounded by '[' and ']' are syslog messages and are in green
if you have color on.

The messages you receive are level dependent.

Examples:

  > syslog complete
  > syslog off

See also: COLOR
#31
TEDIT

Usage: tedit <text file>

This command allows you to edit - using the enhanced editor - a number of
text files and save these to disk.

See Also: OASIS OASIS-EDIT
#1
TEXT-EDITOR TEXTEDITOR /d /i /h /s /a /c /ra /l /fi WORDWRAP WORD-WRAP FORMATTING /e#
   The text editor is what you use to write room/mob/obj/extra descriptions,
mudmails, and even boards. It allows you more commands than the typical entry.
To learn the commands while using the text editor, type /h. It will tell you
what all the / commands do. Always use /fi to format, indent, and word wrap.
It looks much better to see writing that is formatted than one that runs all
over the place wrapping around etc. Just simply type /fi on a new line and hit
enter. Before you save type /l to list the buffer and see for yourself how it
looks. Fix as needed.
   When entering the text editor for the first time make sure to use /c to clear
the current contents. Indent and format all descriptions by typing /fi (format
with indent) in the text editor.  This includes all forms of OLC, mudmails,
boards, and anywhere else you use the text editor. This will indent the line
by 3 spaces and wrap your text at less than 80 characters so telnet users can
read it.
 
Editor command formats: /<letter>
 
@n/a         -  aborts editor
@n/c         -  clears buffer
@n/d#        -  deletes a line #
@n/e# <text> -  changes the line at # with <text>
@n/f         -  formats text. 
@n/fi        -  indented formatting of text (highly recommended for all desc's)
@n/h         -  list text editor commands
@n/i# <text> -  inserts <text> before line #
@n/l         -  lists buffer
@n/n         -  lists buffer with line numbers
@n/r 'a' 'b' -  replace 1st occurance of text <a> in buffer with text
@n/ra 'a' 'b'-  replace all occurances of text <a> within buffer with text
        usage: /ra 'pattern' 'replacement'
@n/s         -  saves text

NOTE: /f and /fi in trigedit will autoindent your trigger.
Commands such as /r, /n, /e#, /i#, /d# are invaluable and will make your job
much easier. For example lets say you mistype "the" with "teh" in a 10 line
description. Instead of /c (clearing) the text you can /r 'teh' 'the' or if it
was on line 5 you can type /e5 <line with teh spelled correctly> or /d5. Learn
all these options.

THIEF THIEVES

Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other class offers.
Their specialty tends to be in the darker, sneakier art.  Many of these
qualities can come in handy in many situations, such as picking locks.

You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to thieves:

sneak, hide, steal, backstab, pick lock, track

See the help on each skill for more information.

See also: PRACTICE
#1
TIME

Usage: time

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#1
TITLE

Usage: title <new title>

Sets the title people see on the WHO list and when you're in the room with
them.  You can't use parentheses (the "(" and ")" characters) because those
are reserved for flags.

Do not abuse this command; if you do, it will be taken from you.

See also: FLAGS, WHO
#1
TLIST TRIGLIST TRIG-LIST TRIGEDIT-LIST 

Usage: tlist <range of vnums or zone number>

Tlist gives you a list of the triggers numbered within the parameters.
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 13, 40, 41 is a 
good start.

   tlist 13          - lists all triggers defined in zone 13
   tlist 4000 4099   - lists all existing triggers from vnum 4000 to 4099
   
See also: TSTAT, TRIGEDIT, OLC
#0
TOGGLE

Usage: toggle

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the MUD.
This command CAN NOT be used to change these values (see related commands.)
All of these toggles remain the same until you change them; i.e. they are
saved when you quit or rent.

          REPEAT, WIMP
#1
TRACK

Usage: track <victim>

Used for finding the first step on the shortest route to a monster.

Example:

  > track fido
  You sense a trail south from here!
#1
TRIG-ATTACH

Usage: attach vnum id
* This small trigger will attach a trigger to the carrier this can for instance 
* be used if you want the mob to change attitude by adding another trigger 
* (ie - mob was mad - mob got apple - mob gets a 'nicer' trigger attached
attach 3001 %self.id% 

   This command allows a script to attach a trigger (referenced by vnum) to 
anything capable of receiving triggers, by id number. (%self.id%, %object.id%, 
and %actor.id% are examples of id numbers, for use with this command.)

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-DETACH
#0
TRIG-DETACH

Usage: detach <vnum | all> id
* if we - as described in the attach example, want our mob/obj/room to behave
* differently, it's not always enough to just add another trigger with attach.
* it might be necessary to remove some old ones :
detach 3000 %self.id%
or
detach all %self.id%

   The opposite of attach, this removes triggers from the specified target.

Example: @RTSTAT 45@n

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-ATTACH
#0
TRIG-RETURN
 
Usage: return 0
 
   Return sets the return value of the trigger. Normally, a script will return
1, unless return 0 is specified. Unlike most computer languages, the return  
command does not end the trigger's execution. The value is returned after all 
the commands have been executed, or a wait or halt command is called. 

Example: @RTSTAT 1364@n

See Also: HALT, WAIT
#0
TRIG-SET

Usage: set <variable> <value>

Set sets variable to value, without evaluating it. 
 Example: set foobar 15 - 5
 sets the variable foobar to the string "15 - 5"

* this example sets the value of result to '%self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp%'
set result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
* The %result% var now works as a 'function' every time it's accessed.
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
%damage% %self% 30
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%

   The set command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the provided expression, which will be evaluated when the variable is accessed. 
There also exists an "eval" command, with the same syntax. Eval differs in that 
the expression is evaluated immediately.

See Also: EVAL
#0
TRIG-SWITCH TRIGEDIT-SWITCH CASE DEFAULT BREAK

Usage: switch expression
    
switch %random.4%
  case 1
    emote sings a merry song about someone named Fulbert and Beatrice.
  break
  case 2
    emote booms out loudly, 'Heigh Ho! Heigh Ho! It's home from work we go!'
  break
  case 3
    emote tries to sing falsetto, but his voice doesn't agree.
  break
  default
    sing
  break
done

   Switch evaluates an expression and looks for a match amongst the case 
statements that follow. If none of the following case statements are a match, 
and a default statement exists, the default statement is considered a match. 
If a match is found, the commands that follow it, up until a break or done 
command, are executed. 
Break is used to terminate commands in a switch. 
Case is used to begin a new conditional group in a switch block.
Default is similiar to case but matches any condition not met. 
Done is used to terminate a while or switch block.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED

@RWARNING: long and verbose (wordy)@n

To add life to the worlds circlemud uses something called scripts (or triggers). 
There are three major types of game objects which can use scripts. These are 
mobiles (mobs), objects, and rooms (world objects). Examples of scripts in the 
game are: 

Cityguards screaming 'PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!', (a mob script).
A portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object script).
A room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room script).

Each game item (room, mobile, or object) can have a script. A script is composed
of one or more triggers, which work in collaboration to define complex actions 
of the game object. A trigger is a definition of an event that the script watches 
for, and list of commands to execute when that event occurs. 

There are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines
when the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked
every time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses
the 'say' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character
enters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the
trigger's commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical
argument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and
some may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on
the type, and is described in more detail on the webpage and in the help files.

When an event in the game occurs, each script in the room where the event 
occurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to
react to that event. A trigger currently running (such as from a 'wait'
command) is skipped. Only one trigger of each script will be run by a single
event. For example, if there are two triggers on a script, and both are the
same type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the
first one is already running. 

Triggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,
a trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common
combined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger
would be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the
same argument and numerical argument. 

The other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of
commands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from
two groups of commands, script specific commands and game commands. Script
specific commands are those commands that only the script interpreter can
recognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,
halt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,
eval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could
issue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,
objects, and rooms.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL

This section is a step by step tutorial to explain the writing of scripts 
(triggers). It goes through the script creation process developing a practical
script. 

Decide what you want the script to do. 
   Consider how your mob, item, or room should behave. Doing this before
worrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have
seen other scripts do, and allows you to produce a more interesting script. 
  
For example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The ruler
of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten coins to
enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to enter,
collect the money, allow people who have payed to enter the city, and close the
gate after them. This will be a mob script. 
  
Decide what trigger types you need.
   Look through the section on triggers to see the currently available trigger
types. New trigger types can be added by one of the implementors if needed. All
types are listed in the help files @RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPE@n.
  
Our gate guard needs to react to five different events: 

1. A character entering the room from the south, the road leading away from the
   town, needs to be informed of the price for entrance. This will be a greet
   trigger. 
2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This
   is done by a bribe trigger. 
3. If the guard is given less than ten coins, the guard needs to inform the
   character that it is insufficient. This is also a bribe trigger. 
4. When someone passes through the gate into the city, the guard must close the
   gate behind them. This is done with an act trigger. 
5. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close
   it. This will be another act trigger. 

Determine the argument and the numerical argument of the triggers. Read the 
specifications on trigger types, and decide what the values for argument and 
Numeric Arg must be for the trigger to react appropriately to the events.
  
@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET@n
Argument    : not used 
Numeric Arg : the percent chance that the trigger is run when checked. Since I 
              want it run every time someone enters the room, it should be 100. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE@n
Argument    : not used
Numeric Arg . minimum number of gold pieces required to activate this trigger.
              The guard should only open the gate when given 10 coins, so it
              should be 10. 

For the second bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives 
him 1 or more coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACT@n
Argument    : the text the mob should react to. Since I want the guard to 
              react to a character going north, argument should be "leaves 
              north." 
Numeric Arg : Since argument is a phrase, NArg should be 0. 

The second act trigger should trigger on text "The gate is opened from the other
side", so it is triggered whenever someone opens the gate from inside the town.
Again, Numeric Arg should be 0 for a phrase. 
  
Write the list of commands for the trigger.
This is the most complex and time consuming part of a trigger to write. The
valid commands are explained in the help files and on the webpage. Variables 
and expressions are also used in the commands list.

For the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the
south how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is
entering from the south. If they are entering from that direction, the guard
should tell the character the cost of entry. The command list for this trigger
will be as follows: 
  
if (%direction% == south) 
 wait 1 sec
 emote snaps to attention as you approach. 
 wait 1 sec
 say Admittance to the city is 10 coins. 
end 
 
Checking the specifications of the greet trigger, we see that the variable
"direction" is set to the direction that the character entered. The percent
sign surrounding direction means it is a variable. The two equal signs together
compare the value of the variable to the word "south". If these are equal, the
statements between this line and the line "end" will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"
pauses briefly while the character finishes his move. (The greet trigger is
actually checked before the character enters the room, so if we did not have
this line, he or she would never see the guard snap to attention.) After
another brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The
indentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. 

The guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. The
command list looks like this: 
  
wait 1 sec
unlock gate 
open gate 
wait 10 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
After a brief wait (so everything doesn't happen at once), the guard unlocks
the gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if
no one passes through it. 

The guard must inform the character that his payment was not enough, and
return the money. The commands list will be: 
  
wait 1 sec
say This is not enough! 
give %amount% coins %actor.name% 
  
For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the variables amount and actor,
both set when the bribe trigger is called, are substituted into the line before
the guard performs the command. The gate guard returns the number of coins he
was given. 

For the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after
someone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn't
shutting the gate on the character's back, and close and lock the gate. The
command list will be: 

wait 1 sec
close gate 
lock gate 
  
For the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it 
is opened from the other side. The commands will look like: 
  
wait 5 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
The "wait 5 sec" gives time for someone on the other side to get through the gate. 
Decide the order of the triggers. The triggers are checked from first to last.
If there are two triggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only
one run. 

There are two sets of triggers which are the same type, the bribe triggers and
the act triggers. If the bribe trigger with the Numeric Arg of 1 is first, the 
other trigger would never be run, since ten or more coins is still one or more. 
In order for my triggers to work right, the trigger with Numeric Arg of 10 must 
be before the trigger with the NArg of 1 in the list. The other possible 
conflict is with the act triggers. Since both have arguments that will not 
occur together, the order does not matter. 

Create the trigger file.
Simply use trigedit to create your triggers and they will be saved for you
when you exit the editor. 

Put the triggers into the game.
In the OasisOLC medit / redit / oedit menus, use menu option S to enter the
script editor. Then select the triggers that will be part of your script. Note,
that order is important! If there are two possible triggers that could both be
executed at the same time, only the first one found in the list will be
activated. In this example, it means place the bribe trigger for 10 or more
coins BEFORE the bribe trigger for 1 coin. 

Test the script.
You should see how the script actually works in the game, and watch other
people interact with it. Often you will see ways you can improve it. 

@RGOTO 1310@n and work your way north to test these out. Triggers 4-8.

TRIGEDIT-COMMANDLISTS

6) Commands:
@csay My trigger commandlist is not complete!@n
This is the command list, which contains the actions which take place, when the 
trigger is executed. The command list makes use of the @RHELP TEXT-EDITOR@n.
This is often called the 'script', and is actually a small program, executed 
step by step. In it, you can use different types of commands: script - specific 
commands, flow control commands - if this is a mobile script, you can use 
standard mud commands like say or give.

TRIGEDIT-MOB-TUTORIAL TRIGEDIT-TUTORIAL

Mob trigger tutorial
This mini-quest is setup in TBA as an example. @RGOTO 1310@n and work your way north
with nohassle off.
 
The following 7 steps should give you a general idea about what to do, and how to go 
about making small quests in the dg scripting language. This example is concentrated 
on quests involving mobs. 

The process can be broken down to the following:  
   1. Decide what you want the script to do.
   2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.
   3. Split up the quest.
   4. Find corresponding trigger types.
   5. write the scripts for the triggers.
   6. Attach the scripts - permanently
   7. Done ? 
   
1. Decide what you want the script to do.  
   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest 
will work like this: When you enter the room, where the first mob is, it will 
start to tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task, in 
this case, kill an evil ogre, that lives in a nearby forest. As proof of the 
kill, you must bring back the ogre's apprehension to the questgiving mob. 

2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  
   Ingredients for this quest:
      1 Questgiver mob - I've chosen 'the questmaster' - vnum 1310
      1 Target mob - In this case 'an apprehensive Ogre' - vnum 1311
      1 Quest object - 'some apprehension' - trash object, vnum 1300 

3. Split up the quest.  
   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In 
this example, we have three steps: 
   Player entering room -> tell story 
   Player finds ogre -> load object (Do not just want the mob to carry it) 
   Player gives questmaster apprehension -> reward player 

4. Find corresponding trigger types.  
   Having split the quest up also means we reasonably easy can decide what 
kinds of triggers we need - in this case: 
   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) 
   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) 
   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) 
 
5. write the scripts for the triggers.  
    Up to this point, neither trigedit or the script editors have been used. 
All the info needed is in the help files and on the webpages. Notice most of
the work required is PLANNING! You must know exactly what you want to do before
you do it. Now is the time to fire up trigedit and start editing the triggers. 
Let's give the first one vnum 0, and edit it to look like the script below: 


> trigedit 0
Trigger Editor [0]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Quest Offer@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yGreet @n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* we don't want him to tell this to mobs. vnum -1 is reserved for players.
if %actor.vnum% == -1
  * only greet players coming from the south.
  if %direction% == south
    *wait 1 second, always give the player time before you start sending text.
    wait 1 sec
    say Can you help me, %actor.name%?
    wait 1 sec
    say An apprehensive ogre has something of mine.
    wait 1 sec
    say If you slay him I'll give you all the coins I can spare.
    wait 1 sec
    say Please, bring me the apprehension he has stolen.
  end
end@n

The script above will be executed every time anyone enters the room. If the 
person entering is a mobile, the if check at the beginning will stop the 
execution. Note, that I've named the trigger as I did above. ALWAYS include
the VNUM of where you plan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so 
it is easy to see what part of the quest this trigger handles. The second 
script is very simple.

> trigedit 1
Trigger Editor [1]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1311 - Kill ogre@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yDeath@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@csay you got the best of me %actor.name%.
* load some apprehension
%load% obj 1300
* reload the mob for the next questor
%load% mob 1311@n

The above script will be executed when the mob is killed - just before the 
death cry. The last script just needs to check if the object handed over is 
the correct one. Let's see it, here with vnum 2: 

> trigedit 2
Trigger Editor [2]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Give/Quest Completion@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yReceive@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* check if this was indeed the right object
if %object.vnum% == 1300
  wait 1 sec
  say Thank you, %actor.name%
  %send% %actor% %self.name% gives you a gold piece.
  %echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% is rewarded for his valor.
  nop %actor.gold(1)%
  wait 5 sec
  %purge% obj 1300
else
  * this wasn't the right object - don't accept it
  say I don't want that - bring me back my apprehension.
  return 0
end@n

The script above is pretty self explanatory, but to clarify a bit: First check 
if the object is the correct vnum, then give the reward, and send messages to 
the player and others in the room. If it wasn't the object, reject it, and use 
the return value of the script to prevent the object being passed over. Lastly, 
and very importantly, 'end' ends the if. 

6. Attach the scripts - permanently  
   Proceed and add the scripts to the two mobiles through medit: 

> medit 1310
[medit menu]
Enter choice ? S
     Script Editor

     Trigger List:
     <none>

 N)  New trigger for this script
 D)  Delete a trigger in this script
 X)  Exit Script Editor

     Enter choice :
Here, add the scripts by typing N, then the script vnum: 
Enter choice : n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 0
Enter choice ? n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 2
Enter choice ? x

And add the trigger vnum 3 to the ogre in a similar manner. 

7. Done ?  
   The scripts are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your 
mud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for 
considering improvements to the little quest: 

Balance issues: 
   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? 
   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? 
Gameplay issues: 
   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the old man ? 
   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? 
   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? 

The above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but 
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

TRIGEDIT-NAMES TRIG-NAMES

1) Name         : @ynew trigger@n

Always use names that explain the trigger. More importantly: always include the
VNUM for the mob/obj/room the trigger is going to be attached to.

   It's important to give your trigger a name you and others can understand. 
Even more important is including the VNUM of what it is attached to. This way
tlist and stat will show the name description and VNUM allowing others to 
quickly comprehend what the trigger does. A good name could be 'guard shout for
help - 101' or 'mage cast poison - 300' even 'cursed object - 130.'

Examples:
   Quest Offer - 1310       --> trigger attached to mob 1310
   Fall Down Stairs - 1300  --> trigger attached to room 1300
   No Dropping Stuff - 1301 --> trigger attached to obj 1301
#0
TRIGEDIT-OBJ-CAST

TRIGEDIT-OBJ-COMMAND TRIGEDIT-OBJECT-COMMAND TRIG-OBJ-COMMAND

Activates when commands are performed in the same room as the object.
This does not work for level 32 and above.

Numeric Arg : a bitfield to indicate where the object must be in order to cause 
              the trigger to activate. 
              Bits: 1: In character's worn equipment.
                    2: In character's carried inventory.
                    4: In same room with the character.

TRIGEDIT-TRIGGER-TYPES

3) Trigger types: @yGreet@n
This is a bitvector  of which kind of events this trigger is triggered by. This 
is the most important part of the trigger. It's here you decide if you want the 
trigger to react on people dying in the room, dropping objects, saying stuff, 
entering, jumping insanely up and down or whatever else you might think of.

This part is also the most important, in the sense that the rest of the triggers' 
info means different things, depending on what trigger type the trigger has.

TRIGEDIT-VARIABLES VARIABLES TRIG-VARS TRIG-VARIABLES VARS 

Variables appear as a name surrounded by '%'s, such as %actor% 

Before a command is processed, the line is scanned and any variables are
replaced. First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable
is there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must
have a zero context or the current context of the script. (When a script starts
running, its context is 0. The script context command may be used to change
context.) If a match is still not found, a list of 'built in' variables (ones
not declared by the script) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is
replaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and
nothing added in its place).

There are two types of variables, local and global. All local variables are
deleted when a trigger finishes executing, and can only be used by the trigger.
Global variables remain until removed with unset, or the script is removed. 

Global variables also have a context associated with them. By default, the
context is 0. Any global being referenced with a context of zero will be seen.
Through the 'context <value>' command, a script may set its context to any
integer; Globals created are always assigned the current script context. When a
global is referenced, if it's context is not 0 or the current context of the
script, it will not be seen. This technique allows, among other things, arrays
of globals to be created by using a series of contexts as indexes. Also, it
allows globals to be associated with a specific character, room, or object in
the game, by using the id of the target as the context. 

Variable Fields 

A field of a variable can also retrieved, based on their type. To get a field,
a notation of %variable.field% is used. The valid fields are listed in the help
files below. 

@RCHAR-VAR@n - Variables for characters.    @RTSTAT 27@n
@ROBJ-VAR@n  - Variables for objects.       @RTSTAT 28@n
@RROOM-VAR@n - Variables for rooms.         @RTSTAT 29@n
@RTEXT-VAR@n - Variables for text.          @RTSTAT 30@n
@RSPEC-VAR@n - Variables for special stuff. @RTSTAT 31@n

   These fields pertain to any variable that contains a string of text. These 
are often the variables, such as %speech%, which are provided to a script, but 
can also be variables that have been created by the script, such as 
%room.north% 

When using field - The variable returns
 
strlen     - Returns the number of characters in the string.
trim       - Returns the string without any leading or trailing whitespace. 
             This is used to trim extra spaces from the beginning or end of a 
             string.
car        - Returns the first word of the string. For %text%="this is the 
             string"; %text.car% will yield "this". @RTSTAT 53@n
cdr        - Returns all but the first word of the string, trimmed. For %text%=
             "this is the string"; %text.cdr% will yield "is the string". 
contains() - Subfield used for comparison.
mudcommand - Returns the mud command the string is shorthand for. Used to make 
             sure the command you react to is the one you want: For %text%="o"
             %text.mudcommand% will yield "open". @RHELP MUDCOMMAND@n

Example: @RTSTAT 30@n

TSTAT TRIGEDIT-EXAMPLES EXAMPLES TRIG-EXAMPLES

Usage: tstat <trigger vnum>

Tstat lets you learn more about a specific trigger. 
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 0 are the basic
examples. For more examples check out zones 13, 19, 27, 29, 77, 236 and 
237. There are numerous others. Look around, just beware some may not be
"good" examples. 

To learn more about any of these just tlist <zone #> then tstat each
trigger individually. You can always ask Rumble to find you an example.

ZEDIT

Usage: zedit [<room number>]
       zedit new <zone> <bottom room> <top room>
       zedit save [<zone>]

The zedit command is used to create new zones, change the characteristics
of existing zones, and create and edit individual zone commands.

The first variant of the zedit command is used to change values for an 
existing zone and add or modify the zone commands that relate to a particular
room.  If no room number is given, zedit will work with the room the player is
currently in, or if a room number is specified, it will work with the zone
that contains that room.  The zedit menu is in two parts, the upper part 
being used to set the overall value for the total zone (zone name, reset
mode, and so on), while the lower part lists the zone commands that relate
to the particular room.

The second variant is used to create a brand new zone, specifying the zone
number and the range of room vnums that the zone contains.  This will bring
up the standard zone edit menu.

The third (and final) variant will save the complete zone to the disk file,
for either the zone specified or, if no zone number was entered, for the 
zone that the player is currently in.
