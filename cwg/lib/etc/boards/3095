z12: Reorganization
   I'd like a builder to reorganize z12 (the Imm zone).  We need to include a
room for each of the three types of imms (social, building, coder) and link them
together coherently.

   Currently, I am using r1204 as the "coder board", but this won't be perm-
anent. Be sure to include a coder room that has a new vnum.

   Additionally, I don't feel the need to put in an 'implementer' board room;
I'd rather not encourage secrecy based on imm level with a board.

Build Flags
   When creating objects, you may notice that some wear flags
are missing (ANKLE, FEET, ONBACK, and BACK). I am aware of the
problem and am working to fix it.

   In the meantime you may proceed with building normally.

@WCity Building List.@n
1: Palanthas. -Good Align starting city.-
2: Sanction. -Evil Align starting city.-
3: Tarsis. -Port City, link a road to Sanction.-
4: Hylo. -Close to Palanthas, later Kender choice of starting.-
5: Mithas. -Will be a starting city for Minotaurs later.-
6: Silvanesti. -Elven starting city choice-
7: Qualinesti. -Elven starting city choice.-
8: Gnome town outside of Mt. Nevermind.  -Nevermind to come later.-
9: Underwater town. -Sea Elf starting city.-
10: Vingaard, and Solanthus
11: kalaman, and Yeraka landing to Karthay
12: Istar
13: Work on outskirts of each city, in the same order.

This will be our list, trying to get most of the major 
cities done. Hitting the port cities first, since they can 
be linked up via the boats. Roads will come later, though
if it is a short distances between something that is fine.
Any more ideas, or think something in the list should change. Post Back :)

Also post which cities you would like to do, or have ideas for.
