   Newly planted trees line the center of the large main road.  To the east and
the west, the road continues, each side being met with a large middle class
citizens of Palanthas, one to two story homes, some without yards.  This area of
the city however is still relatively safe from the crime in palanthas and people
walk without a worry in the world.  These are good times in this city, showed in
evidence by the road which is constantly fixed and given a new look almost every
year.

   The songs of birds litter the air with a peaceful melody as you pass along
the road, various homes on either side of the usual middle class with a few
upper class homes with large yards.  The road continues along the east and the
west, both sides being met with a large gate.  Most of the people walking this
street are commoners; farmers, artisans and the like, going about their business
without a care of the world outside the gates.

   The middle class homes on each side of the road are the newest additions to
the city.  These two stories houses all have a small yard with vines creeping up
their walls.  Venders using small wagons as means for shops stay underneath the
shade from the oak tree's in the center of the road.  Trading caravans and
farmers from outside the city pour in and out of the massive gates to the east,
at peaks hours of the day sometimes clogging into the gate.

Nobles' Way~
   Venders crowd either side of the street to try to take advantage of the
travelers entering this city to the massive gate to the west.  The sound of
horses's feet hitting the red bricks almost a white noise in this area due to
the amount of traffic seen.  In peak hours of the day this part of the city can
become quite crowded with people.  Oak trees line both the middle and the sides
of the streets with benches underneath for travelers to rest their feet from
walking to this city.

Nobles' Way~
   Large walls ban passage into the two, sometimes three story homes that line
the sides of the red-bricked street.  Hired guards patrol the edges of these
walls, preventing thieves from entering the homes and becoming rich off the
wealthy nobles.  The center of the street lies a statue of a Knight of the rose,
his long sword pointed to the east gate as a challenge to that reads "Est
Sularus oth Mithas" my honor is my life.  Invaders.  Beneath the knight's feet
lies a iron pedestal with a golden plaque
